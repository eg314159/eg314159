Hi! I'm a PhD student in the Princeton theoretical computer science group. Before that, I did my undergrad at Columbia University, where I double-majored in mathematics and computer science. I'm broadly interested in randomized algorithms, particularly streaming/sketching, high-dimensional geometry, and communication complexity.
